# Telstra-SMS-API
Sample code for interacting with Telstra's SMS API.

When you run the code, the terminal will ask for the consumer key and secret followed by the recipients number and the message.
the terminal will then ask if you would like to send another message, if the user types anything other than n, the terminal asks for the number and message again.
This prevents the user having to enter their key and secret every time they want to send a message.
